          I first learned to code when I was 11, but didn't start persuing it seriously until recently. I'm now self-studying to gain the skills to become a web developer.

        <!-- <p>
          I first learned to code when I was 11, thanks to a STEM summer program. Over the years since then, I've had an on-again, off-again relationship with coding. Thanks to
          a few excellent courses on Udemy, the flame has recently been rekindled and I'm pursuing the art with more vigor than ever before.

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy balancing out my tech time with time spent in nature. I find gardening to be one of my favorite outdoor activities. The patience and diligence required to code also applies to growing things.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          It wasn't until this spring (2019) that I seriously tried my hand at gardening. Turns out, my thumbs are greener than I thought! My family and I have cultivated a number of healthy tomatoes, peppers, sunflowers, and various herbs. I even volunteer at the community children's garden.
