      <h3>My Journey with Code</h3>
      <p>
        My first experience with coding was the summer before  6<sup>th</sup> grade. I was part of the Prefreshman Engineering Program (PREP), which gave San Antonio area students the opportunity to spend the summer at one of the city's numerous colleges and universities learning all things STEM related (though that wasn't yet a buzzword). It was at PREP that I would be introduced to HTML and the awesome feeling of building a website. The course didn't go too deep in the few weeks wewere there, but the <em>feeling</em> I got from typing a few lines and seeing an image of Tweety Bird (yes, that was our subject matter) appear in IE never left me. I wish I had saved those floppy disks of my first web pages.

        While I wouldn't touch HTML again until I was in my mid-twenties, the satisfaction I recieved from coding endeared me to elect to take a college-level introductory programming course at UTSA during my 4<sup>th</sup> and final summer of PREP. The course introduced me to Java and ended just shy of jumping into object oriented programming (OOP). I enjoyed programming and took to it naturally but I never fell in love with the task so I get programming in my pocket as a back up incase my other
        interests didn't pay off.

        Fast forward to just after my first semester in college and coding would once again enter my life. The previous semester had been a hard fought victory over my core classes for my Physics major but I decided the pursuit just wasn't for me.
